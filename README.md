# ApacheTomcat_Monitoring_Plugin
As we know, not all linux would automatically switches on the apache tomcat service. Since Apache Tomcat is crucial for a server hosting WebApp, this plugin is useful to monitor Apache Tomcat status every minute and logs it's information for analysis as needed.
Sure! Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` that outlines the steps to set up and use your Tomcat monitoring script from GitHub.

# Tomcat Monitoring Script

This script monitors the Apache Tomcat process and logs its status, CPU, and memory usage. It also sends email notifications if Tomcat is not running or if resource usage exceeds specified thresholds.

## Features

- Monitors Apache Tomcat process status.
- Logs CPU and memory usage.
- Sends email alerts for critical issues.
- Configurable CPU and memory usage thresholds.

## Prerequisites

- Apache Tomcat installed and running.
- Bash shell (Linux or macOS).
- `mail` command or equivalent installed for email notifications.
- `bc` utility installed for floating-point calculations.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**

   Navigate to the directory where the script is located and make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x monitor_tomcat.sh
   ```

3. **Configure the Script**

   Open the `monitor_tomcat.sh` script in a text editor and configure the following settings:

   - `LOG_FILE`: Path where you want to store the log file.
   - `EMAIL`: Your email address to receive notifications.
   - `CPU_THRESHOLD` and `MEM_THRESHOLD`: Set your desired resource usage thresholds.

   Example:
   ```bash
   LOG_FILE="/path/to/tomcat_monitor.log"
   EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
   CPU_THRESHOLD=80
   MEM_THRESHOLD=80
   ```

4. **Install Email Utility**

   If you don't have a mail utility installed, you can install one. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mailutils
   ```

   On Red Hat/CentOS, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install mailx
   ```

5. **Add to Crontab**

   To schedule the script to run every minute, add it to your crontab:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line (make sure to use the correct path to your script):

   ```bash
   * * * * * /path/to/monitor_tomcat.sh &>> /path/to/tomcat_monitor.log
   ```

6. **Verify Functionality**

   You can manually run the script to ensure it works as expected:

   ```bash
   /path/to/monitor_tomcat.sh
   ```

   Check the log file to see if entries are being recorded properly.
